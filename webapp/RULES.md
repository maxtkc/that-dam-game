That Dam Game

A deck contains the usual 52 cards, plus 2 Jokers. Two decks for three people, three decks for four or five, four decks for more. [would it be easier to just call it 4 decks?]

Sets = cards of the same number (always 3). Example - K of diamonds, K of spades, K of clubs. Wild cards never allowed to represent a card other than what they are (ie - three “2’s” are OK)

    Runs = sequential cards of the same suit, of varying length (ie - a straight in poker). A is always high. The ‘wheel’ is not permitted (ie - K,A,2,3,4 is NOT allowed).

    Wild cards are 2’s and Jokers

    Six cards—two sets of three
    Seven cards—one set of three and one run of four—can have one wild card in run
    Eight cards—two runs of four—can have one wild card in each run
    Nine cards—three sets of three
    Ten cards—one set of three and one run of seven—can have three wild cards in run
    Eleven cards—two sets of three and one run of five—can have two wild cards in run
    Twelve cards—three runs of four—can have one wild card in each
    Thirteen cards—one set of three and one run of ten—can have four wild cards in run
    Fourteen cards—two sets of three and two runs of four—can have one wild card in each run
    Fifteen cards—three runs of five—can have two wild cards in each run


    Number of Players: at least three and up to six (for the app)

    Order of Play:

    NOTE: Assume play will need to be “gentle” version, since low bandwidth may make it impossible for some people to timely “beg”.

    Dealer is randomly assigned, and deals the specified hand (as above) in clockwise direction.  All play moves clockwise.

    After dealing, dealer places remaining cards in a deck in center of table.  Player to left of dealer plays first.  Only choice is to take card from top of deck.  Then player 1 must discard a card of their choice from their hand (visually the discard pile is to side of deck).  Then player to left of first player plays.  From this point forward, when it’s your turn you can either take 1 card from the deck and discard one card, or take card player before you discarded (cannot take any card below discarded one).

    Following the discard, if the next player up does not want the discarded card, any other player can “beg” for the card. (Offered in direction of play)  If successful, the “beggar” gets both the discarded card, AND the next card off of the top of the deck.  Play resumes, and the player who allowed the beg must take the next card off of the top of the deck (cannot take an older discard).

    Note: Each player may “beg” only 3 times during the entire game [round] (all hands).

    Play continues until a player gets all cards required for the specified hand.  The player must wait until it’s his turn to “meld” - putting all required cards down on the table (and ONLY the required cards - any extra cards must be held), and to discard one card. If a player did not beg, the hand will be over.  If they DID beg, play continues until one player has no cards left.

    After melding, at their turn, a player can add to their own meld, or anyone else’s.  Cards can be played on a meld until the full spec is reached.  Sets can be added to infinitely.  A player can add to runs until all 13 cards are represented.  Wild cards can be moved as desired, providing the run remains intact.

    When one player has no cards left in his hand, the game [round] ends, and all remaining cards in each player’s hand are totalled. 



    A set is three cards regardless of suit, three fours, three kings etc.
    A run must be in same suit in sequence.
    Wild cards are deuces and jokers—deuce does not have to be in same suit as run.
    Three deuces or three jokers can be a set.
    Deuce can be played as a two, but value remains at 20 points.

    Scoring Values:
    Ace—always highest card—15 points
    Ten thru king—10 points
    Three thru nine—5 points
    Deuce—20 points
    Joker—fifty points

    Points are totalled for each hand [round] and accrue through the game.  Lowest score at the end of the last hand wins, and typically gloats for at least one day, if not several.
